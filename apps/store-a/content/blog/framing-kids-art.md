Every parent faces the same dilemma: your child creates a masterpiece, and you want to display it proudly—but framing means potentially damaging the original. Mounting tape, mat adhesives, and frame clips can all harm delicate paper and artwork. The solution? Frame copies and preserve the originals safely.

## Why Not Frame the Original?

Kids' artwork is often created on construction paper, cardstock, or lightweight paper that degrades over time. Mounting and framing introduces several risks:

- **Adhesive damage**: Mounting tape or glue permanently alters the artwork
- **Light exposure**: UV rays fade colors and yellow paper
- **Humidity and temperature**: Can warp paper or cause deterioration
- **Accidents**: Frames break, kids bump into walls, drinks get spilled

The original artwork is irreplaceable. Framing a high-quality reproduction lets you enjoy the art worry-free while keeping the original pristine.

## Method 1: Digital Scanning and Printing

This is the gold standard for preserving kids' art.

**How it works**:

1. Scan artwork at high resolution (300 DPI minimum, 600 DPI better)
2. Use a flatbed scanner for best quality
3. Save files as high-quality JPEG or PDF
4. Print on archival-quality photo paper or cardstock

**Benefits**:

- Unlimited reproductions—make copies for grandparents too
- Easy to resize to fit standard frames
- Digital files preserved forever
- Original stays safe in a portfolio or storage box

**Where to print**:

- Local print shops (best quality)
- Online services like Nations Photo Lab or Printique
- Home photo printer (if you have one)

**Pro tip**: Create a digital portfolio on your computer organized by year and child. You'll have a complete archive of their artistic journey.

## Method 2: Professional Photography

For 3D artwork, textured pieces, or oversized projects that won't fit in a scanner, photograph them instead.

**Best practices**:

- Use natural, indirect light (near a window, no direct sun)
- Place artwork flat on the floor or tape to a wall
- Photograph straight-on to avoid distortion
- Use your smartphone—modern phone cameras are excellent
- Avoid flash (creates glare and harsh shadows)

**Editing tips**:

- Crop to just the artwork
- Adjust brightness and contrast if needed
- Most phones have built-in editing tools

Then print the photo just like you would a scan. Frame the print, and store the original artwork safely.

## Method 3: Create a Rotating Display System

Can't choose just one piece to frame? Create a system that lets you swap artwork regularly without damaging anything.

**The Picture Ledge Method**:

- Install floating shelves or picture ledges
- Lean framed copies against the wall (no hanging)
- Swap out artwork seasonally or whenever your child creates new pieces

**The Clipframe System**:

- Use clipframes (frameless glass with clips)
- Quick to open and change artwork
- No mounting required—artwork sits between glass and backing
- Warning: This method exposes originals to light and handling

**The Gallery Wire with Clips**:

- String gallery wire or twine across a wall
- Use small clothespins or art clips to hang artwork
- Easy to rotate pieces
- Fun, casual aesthetic for playrooms or bedrooms

## Method 4: Photo Reproduction Services

Several companies specialize in reproducing children's artwork as high-quality prints. They handle scanning, color correction, and printing.

**Services to try**:

- Artkive (app that photographs and stores kids' art)
- Plum Print (creates curated photo books of kids' art)
- Keepsake (scans and creates custom products)

These services are more expensive than DIY but offer professional results and convenience.

## Storing Original Artwork Safely

Once you've created reproductions, store originals properly:

**Short-term storage**:

- Large portfolio case or artist folder
- Flat, dry location
- Organized by child and year

**Long-term storage**:

- Archival boxes with archival tissue paper
- Label clearly (child's name, age, year)
- Store in climate-controlled space (not attic or basement)
- Consider photographing pieces before storage

**Digital backup**:

- Keep scanned files in multiple locations
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- External hard drive
- Printed photo books as physical backup

## Framing the Reproductions

Once you have your prints, frame them beautifully:

**Frame size tips**:

- Most kids' art is 8.5×11, 9×12, or 11×14
- Use standard frame sizes with [mats](/mat-board-guide) to accommodate odd sizes
- Consider [gallery wall layouts](/blog/gallery-wall-layouts) for multiple pieces

**Mat selection**:

- White or cream mats keep focus on the artwork
- Colored mats can complement the art's color palette
- See our guide on [choosing mat colors](/blog/mat-color-combinations)

**Glazing options**:

- [UV glass or framer's grade acrylic](/glazing-guide) prevents fading
- Acrylic is safer for kids' rooms (won't shatter)
- Standard glass is fine for reproductions you'll swap out

**Pro tip**: Create a "featured artist" wall in your home. Frame 3-5 of your child's best pieces in matching frames for a gallery-style display that celebrates their creativity.

## Rotating Displays: Keep It Fresh

Kids create constantly. Don't let old artwork dominate the display:

- **Seasonal rotation**: Change artwork quarterly
- **Age progression**: Display current year's work, archive previous years
- **Theme displays**: Group similar subjects (animals, landscapes, self-portraits)
- **Multi-child rotation**: Give each child equal display time

## Special Projects and 3D Art

Not everything fits in a frame:

**For 3D projects** (clay sculptures, assemblages):

- Photograph from multiple angles
- Create a photo collage to frame
- Store originals in clear bins with photos taped to outside for easy identification

**For oversized pieces** (poster board, large paintings):

- Photograph and print at reduced size
- Consider custom-sized frames for truly special pieces
- Or trim edges if the composition allows

## The Bottom Line

Framing kids' art doesn't mean sacrificing the originals. With digital scanning, photography, and proper storage, you can display your child's creativity proudly while preserving every precious original.

Start by scanning or photographing your child's best work this month. Create prints, design custom frames using our [frame designer](/), and start building a display that celebrates their artistic journey—without risking those irreplaceable originals.

Your kids will treasure these originals when they're older. Keep them safe, frame the copies, and enjoy the art worry-free.
