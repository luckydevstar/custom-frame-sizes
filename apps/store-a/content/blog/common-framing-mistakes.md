Custom framing should be straightforward: measure your artwork, choose a frame, and hang it on the wall. But small mistakes create big frustrations—artwork that doesn't fit, frames that look off-balance, or glass that glares so badly you can't see the image. The good news? Most framing mistakes are easily avoided (or fixed) once you know what to watch for.

## Mistake #1: Measuring Incorrectly

**The problem**: You measure 8×10, order an 8×10 frame, and your artwork doesn't fit—or worse, rattles around loosely inside the frame.

**Why it happens**:

- Measuring the artwork plus the border/margin
- Using a flexible fabric tape instead of rigid ruler
- Measuring at an angle instead of straight
- Assuming printed paper size matches actual image size
- Rounding measurements instead of being precise

**How to fix it**:

### Measure the Visible Image Area Only

If you're using a mat, measure only what you want _visible_ through the mat opening—not the full paper size.

**Example**:

- Your photo is printed on 8.5×11 paper
- But the actual image is 8×10 with white borders
- Order mat with 8×10 opening (not 8.5×11)

### Use a Metal Ruler or Tape Measure

Flexible fabric tapes can stretch and give inaccurate readings. Use a metal ruler for best results.

### Measure Twice (at Minimum)

Measure your artwork's height and width at least twice. Check measurements at different spots on each edge to ensure artwork is perfectly rectangular (not skewed).

### Add 1/8" for Wiggle Room (When Appropriate)

If ordering a mat, the mat opening should be your exact artwork size or 1/8" larger—no more. Too much space and your artwork will slip; too little and it won't fit.

**Full guide**: See our [how to measure guide](/how-to-measure) for step-by-step instructions.

## Mistake #2: Choosing the Wrong Mat Width

**The problem**: Mats that are too narrow make artwork look cramped and crowded. Mats that are too wide overwhelm small pieces and look disproportionate.

**Why it happens**:

- Not understanding the relationship between artwork size and mat width
- Choosing a mat width that looks good on _large_ artwork for your _small_ piece (or vice versa)
- Following arbitrary "rules" without considering your specific piece

**How to fix it**:

### Match Mat Width to Artwork Size

**Small artwork** (5×7, 8×10):

- Use 1.5-2.5" mats
- Narrower mats keep proportions balanced

**Medium artwork** (11×14, 16×20):

- Use 2.5-3.5" mats
- Standard professional width

**Large artwork** (20×24+):

- Use 3.5-4" (or wider) mats
- Larger pieces need more breathing room

### Use Bottom Weighting

For a professional, gallery-quality look, make the bottom mat border 1/4-1/2" wider than the top and sides.

**Example**:

- Top and sides: 2.5"
- Bottom: 3"

This prevents the optical illusion of artwork "sinking" in the frame.

### Preview Before Ordering

Use online design tools (like our [frame designer](/)) to preview mat widths before committing. What looks good in your head might not work in reality.

## Mistake #3: Skipping UV Protection When You Need It

**The problem**: Your framed artwork fades, yellows, or deteriorates over time—and the damage is permanent.

**Why it happens**:

- Choosing standard glass/acrylic to save money
- Not realizing UV damage is cumulative and irreversible
- Underestimating how much natural light affects artwork

**How to fix it**:

### Add UV Protection for Valuable or Irreplaceable Artwork

**Always use UV-protective glazing for**:

- Family photographs (especially color photos)
- Original artwork or limited edition prints
- Artwork displayed in rooms with windows or natural light
- Pieces you want to preserve long-term

**You can skip UV protection for**:

- Mass-produced posters you plan to replace
- Artwork in windowless rooms (basements, interior bathrooms)
- Very temporary displays (less than a year)

### It's Worth the Investment

UV glass or acrylic typically costs $20-40 more than standard glazing—a small price to prevent permanent damage to irreplaceable artwork.

**Full comparison**: See our [glazing guide](/glazing-guide) and [glazing comparison](/blog/glazing-comparison) for details.

## Mistake #4: Choosing the Wrong Glazing for Your Situation

**The problem**: Glare makes your artwork invisible, or your heavy glass frame is nearly impossible to hang safely.

**Why it happens**:

- Not considering where the frame will be displayed (across from windows, bright room, etc.)
- Choosing glass when acrylic would be better (or vice versa)
- Prioritizing cost over practical function

**How to fix it**:

### Match Glazing to Display Location

**Bright room or across from windows**: Use non-glare glass or museum glass (eliminates reflections)

**Large frame (24×36+)**: Use acrylic (half the weight of glass, easier to hang)

**Kids' room or high-traffic area**: Use acrylic (shatter-resistant, safer)

**Small frame with valuable art**: Use museum glass (best protection and clarity)

### Don't Use Non-Glare Glass with Thick Mats

Non-glare glass works best when it's touching (or very close to) the artwork. If you're using a thick mat or deep frame, non-glare glass can appear cloudy.

**Solution**: Use museum glass (anti-reflective but works at any distance) or standard glass.

## Mistake #5: Ignoring Frame Style and Decor Mismatch

**The problem**: Your ornate gold frame clashes with your modern minimalist living room, or your sleek metal frame looks out of place in your traditional dining room.

**Why it happens**:

- Choosing frames based on what you like in isolation, not how they'll look in your space
- Not considering existing furniture and decor style
- Following trends that don't match your home

**How to fix it**:

### Match Frame Style to Room Aesthetic

**Modern/contemporary spaces**:

- Simple frames (black, white, metal)
- Clean lines, minimal ornamentation
- White or gray mats

**Traditional/classic spaces**:

- Wood frames (natural, walnut, mahogany)
- Subtle ornate details acceptable
- Cream or off-white mats

**Farmhouse/rustic spaces**:

- Natural wood frames (light oak, pine)
- Distressed finishes
- Cream mats, warm tones

**Eclectic/bohemian spaces**:

- More freedom to mix styles
- But maintain some consistency (all wood tones, or all same color)

### Consider Frame Color and Furniture

Your frame should complement (not clash with) nearby furniture:

- Dark furniture → frames in similar dark tones or contrasting white
- Light furniture → light wood or white frames work beautifully
- Mixed furniture → neutral frames (black, white, natural wood)

## Mistake #6: Hanging Frames Incorrectly

**The problem**: Frames hang crooked, fall off the wall, sit too high or too low, or create a cluttered appearance.

**Why it happens**:

- Not using proper hanging hardware for frame weight
- Eyeballing height instead of measuring
- Not using a level
- Incorrect spacing in gallery walls

**How to fix it**:

### Use the 57-60 Inch Rule

The center of your artwork should be at eye level—approximately **57-60 inches from the floor**.

**How to measure**:

1. Measure artwork height
2. Divide by 2 (to find center)
3. Measure 57-60 inches up from floor
4. Mark where the center should be
5. Subtract half the artwork height to find top edge
6. Account for hanging hardware and mark nail placement

### Use Proper Hardware for Frame Weight

**Light frames** (under 10 lbs): Standard picture hangers or nails

**Medium frames** (10-25 lbs): Heavy-duty picture hangers or wall anchors

**Heavy frames** (over 25 lbs): Hang from wall studs or use heavy-duty anchors

**Pro tip**: Large frames with acrylic are much easier to hang safely than glass frames. See why in our [acrylic benefits guide](/blog/acrylic-benefits).

### Always Use a Level

Even being slightly off-level is noticeable. Use a small level (or smartphone level app) to ensure frames are perfectly straight.

### Measure Gallery Wall Spacing

For gallery walls, maintain **2-3 inches between all frames**. Inconsistent spacing looks unintentional and messy.

**Full guide**: Check our [gallery wall layouts guide](/blog/gallery-wall-layouts) for hanging tips.

## Mistake #7: Ordering Before Previewing Your Design

**The problem**: The frame arrives and looks nothing like you imagined. Colors clash, proportions are off, or the style doesn't work with your artwork.

**Why it happens**:

- Not using preview tools when ordering online
- Assuming combinations will work without seeing them together
- Ordering based on individual elements without considering the whole

**How to fix it**:

### Always Preview Your Complete Design

Use online design tools that show:

- Frame + mat + artwork together
- Accurate colors (not just descriptions)
- Proportions and dimensions
- How your actual uploaded image looks in the frame

### Test Multiple Combinations

Don't settle for your first design. Try:

- Different mat colors
- Various frame styles
- Different mat widths

Compare your top options side-by-side before ordering.

**Pro tip**: Our [frame designer](/) lets you preview your exact frame combination with live updates and real-time pricing.

## Mistake #8: Using Wrong Frame Orientation

**The problem**: You order a portrait (vertical) frame for a landscape (horizontal) artwork, or vice versa.

**Why it happens**:

- Not double-checking orientation when ordering
- Assuming frames are reversible (some aren't)

**How to fix it**:

### Verify Orientation Before Ordering

- **Portrait**: Vertical (taller than it is wide)
- **Landscape**: Horizontal (wider than it is tall)
- **Square**: Equal width and height

Double-check your artwork orientation matches your frame order.

Most frames can be oriented either way, but always confirm.

## Mistake #9: Forgetting About Hanging Location Limitations

**The problem**: Your beautiful new frame won't fit in the space you intended, or it's too heavy to hang where you wanted.

**Why it happens**:

- Not measuring wall space before ordering
- Not considering furniture placement
- Ignoring weight and hanging limitations

**How to fix it**:

### Measure Your Wall Space

Before ordering, measure:

- Available wall width
- Available wall height
- Distance from furniture to wall

**Rule of thumb**: Frames above furniture should be 6-8 inches above furniture top and no wider than 2/3 the furniture width.

### Consider Frame Weight

Large frames with glass can exceed 20 lbs, making them difficult to hang on drywall. Consider:

- Using acrylic instead of glass (half the weight)
- Hanging on wall studs
- Using heavy-duty anchors

## Mistake #10: Not Reading Return Policies

**The problem**: Your frame arrives damaged, doesn't fit, or looks wrong—but you can't return or exchange it.

**Why it happens**:

- Assuming all companies have fair return policies
- Not reading terms before ordering
- Ordering from sites with "all sales final" policies

**How to fix it**:

### Read Return Policies Before Ordering

Look for:

- Return window (14-30 days typical)
- Return conditions (unused, undamaged)
- Who pays return shipping
- Refund or exchange options

**Red flags**:

- "All custom orders are final sale" (avoid unless you're 100% certain)
- No return policy listed
- Very short return windows (under 7 days)

### Reputable Shops Offer Fair Policies

Quality custom frame shops understand mistakes happen and offer reasonable return/exchange policies. CustomFrameSizes.com provides clear, fair policies because we want you to love your frame.

## The Bottom Line: Avoid These Mistakes

Most framing mistakes come down to:

- Measuring carelessly
- Skipping preview tools
- Choosing wrong materials for your situation
- Not considering display location
- Rushing the design process

**The solution**:

1. Measure twice (or three times)
2. Use preview tools to see your complete design
3. Match materials to your needs (UV protection, acrylic vs. glass, mat width)
4. Plan hanging location before ordering
5. Read policies and reviews before buying

Get these right and your custom frame will be perfect the first time.
