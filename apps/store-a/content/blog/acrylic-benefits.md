When choosing glazing for your custom frame, glass seems like the obvious choice. It's traditional, it's clear, and it's what you've always known. But acrylic (also called plexiglass) deserves serious consideration—especially for specific situations where it outperforms glass in almost every way.

Let's break down why acrylic might be the smarter choice for your framing project.

## What Is Acrylic Glazing?

Acrylic is a clear plastic polymer (polymethyl methacrylate, or PMMA) used as a glass alternative in framing. It's the same material used in aquariums, aircraft windows, and protective barriers—applications where strength and clarity matter.

**Not all acrylic is equal**:

- **Standard acrylic**: Basic clear plastic, economical
- **Framer's grade acrylic**: Blocks 70-98% of harmful UV rays
- **Anti-reflective acrylic**: Reduces glare, similar to non-glare glass
- **Professional-grade acrylic**: Premium clarity and UV protection

For framing, you want at least standard acrylic, but framer's grade acrylic offers the best value for protecting your artwork.

## Benefit #1: Weight Savings (About Half the Weight of Glass)

This is acrylic's most obvious advantage. Acrylic weighs approximately **half as much as glass** of the same size.

**Why this matters**:

**Large frames**: A 24×36 frame with glass can weigh 15-20 pounds. With acrylic, it's 8-10 pounds. That's a significant difference when hanging on drywall.

**Shipping**: Lighter packages cost less to ship and are easier to handle.

**Safety**: Less weight means less risk if the frame falls or is bumped.

**Handling**: Easier to move, carry, and hang—especially for large pieces.

**Wall stress**: Less strain on walls, hooks, and hanging hardware.

**Real-world example**:

- 20×30 glass frame: ~18 lbs
- 20×30 acrylic frame: ~9 lbs
- Savings: 50% weight reduction

For anything larger than 16×20, acrylic's weight advantage becomes increasingly valuable.

## Benefit #2: Shatter-Resistant and Safe

Acrylic is **17 times stronger** than glass in terms of impact resistance. It doesn't shatter into dangerous shards—it cracks or breaks into larger, safer pieces if damaged.

**Safety benefits**:

- **Kids' rooms**: No sharp glass shards if frame is knocked down
- **High-traffic areas**: Less risk in hallways, entryways, or busy spaces
- **Earthquake zones**: Won't shatter and create dangerous debris
- **Public spaces**: Schools, offices, and commercial areas benefit from safer glazing
- **Playrooms and nurseries**: Peace of mind with young children around

**Damage resistance**:

- Withstands impact better than glass
- Less likely to crack during handling
- Survives accidental drops or bumps

While acrylic isn't indestructible, it's significantly safer than glass in high-risk environments.

## Benefit #3: Perfect for Shipping

If your frame is being shipped, acrylic is the clear winner.

**Shipping advantages**:

**Breakage prevention**: Glass shatters easily during shipping, even with careful packing. Acrylic is far more forgiving of bumps and drops.

**Lower shipping costs**: Lighter weight means lower shipping fees, sometimes significantly so for large frames.

**Less packaging required**: Less weight and bulk means simpler, more affordable packaging.

**Insurance savings**: Lower declared value for less fragile materials can reduce insurance costs.

**Customer satisfaction**: Fewer damaged deliveries means fewer returns, replacements, and unhappy customers.

**Industry standard**: Most online custom framing companies use acrylic by default for shipping reasons—it simply makes sense.

If you're ordering custom frames online (like from CustomFrameSizes.com), acrylic ensures your frame arrives intact and ready to hang.

## Benefit #4: Excellent Clarity (When Quality Matters)

One common misconception: "Acrylic isn't as clear as glass."

This is only true for _cheap_ acrylic. **Quality acrylic offers optical clarity comparable to glass**—and in some cases, better.

**Clarity comparison**:

- **Standard glass**: Excellent clarity, slight green tint on edges (thick glass)
- **Standard acrylic**: Good clarity, minimal distortion (quality dependent)
- **Premium acrylic**: Excellent clarity, virtually identical to glass
- **Framer's grade acrylic**: Excellent clarity with added protection

**When acrylic matches or beats glass**:

- Large frames: Glass can bow or have imperfections in big sheets
- UV protection: Framer's grade acrylic protects while maintaining clarity
- Non-glare versions: Anti-reflective acrylic performs similarly to non-glare glass

**The key**: Choose quality acrylic from reputable frame suppliers. Cheap craft-store acrylic will look cloudy and distorted—professional framing-grade acrylic will not.

## Benefit #5: UV Protection Options

Just like glass, acrylic is available with UV-filtering coatings that block harmful ultraviolet rays.

**Framer's grade acrylic**:

- Blocks 70-98% of UV rays (depending on grade)
- Prevents fading, yellowing, and deterioration
- Comparable protection to UV glass
- Often more affordable than UV glass (especially in large sizes)

**Best for**:

- Color photographs
- Artwork in sunny rooms
- Prints and posters you want to preserve
- Any framed piece with long-term value

For more on UV protection, see our [glazing comparison guide](/blog/glazing-comparison).

## Benefit #6: Cost-Effective for Large Frames

While small acrylic and glass are priced similarly, **acrylic becomes more cost-effective as size increases**.

**Price comparison**:

- Small frames (8×10, 11×14): Glass and acrylic similar price
- Medium frames (16×20): Acrylic often slightly cheaper
- Large frames (24×36+): Acrylic significantly cheaper than glass

**Why?**

- Large glass sheets are expensive to produce and ship
- Glass shipping costs increase dramatically with size
- Acrylic is lighter and easier to handle in large sheets

If you're framing a poster (24×36) or large print (30×40), acrylic offers major savings without sacrificing quality.

## When Glass Still Wins

Acrylic isn't always the best choice. Glass has advantages in certain situations:

**Choose glass when**:

- Small frames (8×10 or smaller): Glass is affordable and offers best clarity
- Premium feel matters: Glass has a more "luxury" feel and weight
- Scratch resistance is critical: Glass doesn't scratch as easily
- Display in one permanent location: If you're never moving the frame, weight doesn't matter
- Museum-quality presentation: Museum glass offers unmatched clarity and UV protection

## Common Acrylic Myths Debunked

### Myth 1: "Acrylic scratches too easily"

**Truth**: Quality acrylic is more scratch-resistant than people think. Surface scratches can often be buffed out, unlike glass (which shows every scratch permanently).

**Prevention**: Clean acrylic with proper cleaners (not glass cleaner) and soft microfiber cloths.

### Myth 2: "Acrylic yellows over time"

**Truth**: Cheap acrylic yellows. **Quality UV-stabilized acrylic does not yellow** and maintains clarity for decades.

Always choose archival-grade or UV-stabilized acrylic for framing.

### Myth 3: "Acrylic looks cheap"

**Truth**: Poor-quality acrylic looks cheap. **Premium framing-grade acrylic is virtually indistinguishable from glass** when properly installed.

### Myth 4: "Acrylic attracts dust because of static"

**Truth**: Yes, acrylic can attract dust due to static electricity—but only on the _outside_ of the frame. The inside (your artwork) remains dust-free and protected.

**Solution**: Use anti-static cleaners on the exterior to minimize dust attraction.

## How to Clean Acrylic (Without Scratching It)

Acrylic requires different care than glass. We sell [NOVUS Acrylic Cleaner](/components/acrylic-cleaner) — a professional-grade formula designed specifically for framer's grade acrylic.

**Do**:

- Use acrylic-specific cleaners like [NOVUS](/components/acrylic-cleaner)
- Use soft microfiber cloths
- Wipe gently in circular motions
- Use anti-static spray to reduce dust

**Don't**:

- Use glass cleaner (ammonia damages acrylic)
- Use paper towels (they scratch)
- Rub dry acrylic (use cleaner first)
- Use abrasive materials

With proper care, acrylic stays clear and scratch-free for decades.

## When to Choose Acrylic: Quick Decision Guide

**Choose acrylic if**:

- Frame is 20×24 or larger
- You're shipping the frame
- Frame will hang in a kids' room or high-traffic area
- You want UV protection without premium glass prices
- Weight is a concern (large frames, difficult hanging locations)
- You're framing posters, prints, or mass-produced artwork

**Choose glass if**:

- Frame is small (11×14 or smaller)
- Frame will never move and weight doesn't matter
- You want premium, professional-grade presentation
- You have valuable original artwork
- Scratch resistance is your top priority
