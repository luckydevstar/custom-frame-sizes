Float mounting is a framing method that makes artwork look like it's floating inside the frame. The piece hangs with space around all sides. You can see the edges of the paper or canvas. This creates a clean, modern look that draws attention to your art.

This guide explains what float mounting is, when to use it, and how to do it yourself.

## What Is Float Mounting?

Float mounting attaches artwork to a backing that is smaller than the art itself. The art extends past the backing on all sides. When placed in a deep frame (like a shadowbox), the art appears to hover in mid-air.

**Key elements:**

- Artwork is mounted to a backing board smaller than the piece
- The edges of the artwork are fully visible
- A gap exists between the art and the frame on all sides
- A deep shadowbox frame provides the depth needed

This is different from regular matted framing. With a mat, only part of your art shows through a cut opening. Float mounting shows the entire piece, including its edges.

## When to Use Float Mounting

Float mounting works best for certain types of artwork:

**Good candidates for float mounting:**

- Art on handmade or deckled paper (textured edges add visual interest)
- Prints with interesting edge details or borders
- Watercolors on thick paper
- Limited edition prints where you want to show the full sheet
- Photos printed on thick art paper
- Any piece where the edges are part of the design

**When to skip float mounting:**

- Standard photos or prints with clean-cut edges (matting looks better)
- Very thin paper that might curl or warp
- Pieces that need maximum UV protection (more exposed surface area)
- Budget projects (float mounting requires more materials)

## Materials You Need

**For the float mount:**

- Archival foam board (also called foamcore or foam-centered board)
- Archival mounting tape or adhesive
- Ruler and pencil
- Sharp cutting tool (X-acto knife or mat cutter)
- Cutting mat

**For the frame:**

- Shadowbox frame with 1-2 inches of depth
- Framer's grade acrylic glazing
- Backing board

**Important:** Use archival materials to protect your art. Non-archival foam board can yellow and damage artwork over time.

## Step-by-Step Float Mounting Guide

### Step 1: Measure Your Artwork

Measure the width and height of your art piece. Write these down.

### Step 2: Calculate the Backing Size

The backing should be smaller than your art on all sides. A common approach:

- Subtract 1-2 inches from each dimension
- For an 8x10 piece, a 6x8 backing works well
- For larger art (16x20+), subtract 2-3 inches from each side

The exact amount depends on the look you want. More exposed edge = more dramatic float effect.

### Step 3: Cut the Foam Board

Cut your archival foam board to the size you calculated. Make clean, straight cuts. The backing won't be visible from the front, but clean edges make mounting easier.

### Step 4: Position the Artwork

Lay your artwork face-down on a clean surface. Center the foam board backing on the back of the art. Make sure the margins are equal on all sides.

Use a ruler to check alignment. The foam board should be centered perfectly.

### Step 5: Attach the Artwork

Apply archival mounting tape or adhesive to attach the foam board to the back of your artwork.

**Two methods:**

**Method A - Tape hinges (reversible):**
Apply archival tape strips along the top edge only. This allows the art to hang naturally. Good for valuable pieces you may want to remove later.

**Method B - Full adhesive (permanent):**
Apply archival adhesive across the entire foam board surface. Press firmly. This creates a flat, secure bond. Best for prints and reproductions.

### Step 6: Let It Set

Allow the adhesive to fully bond. Follow the product instructions. Usually 30-60 minutes for tape, longer for spray adhesives.

### Step 7: Choose Your Shadowbox Frame

Select a shadowbox frame that fits your mounted artwork with room to spare. Consider:

- **Depth:** 1-2 inches minimum for the floating effect
- **Size:** Frame opening should be 2-4 inches larger than your art on each side
- **Color:** Neutral frames (black, white, natural wood) let the art stand out

### Step 8: Assemble the Frame

1. Place the glazing in the frame
2. Add any spacers if needed to create proper depth
3. Insert your float-mounted artwork
4. Secure with backing board and frame points
5. Add dust cover and hanging hardware

## Tips for Best Results

**Choose the right backing color:**

The foam board color matters. White backing is most common and works with most art. Black backing creates drama for dark or bold pieces.

**Consider a shadow gap:**

Leave space between the mounted art and the frame edges. This gap creates the "floating" illusion. Too close to the frame edges and the effect is lost.

**Use proper depth:**

The shadowbox should be deep enough that the glazing doesn't touch your art. Allow at least 1/4 inch between glazing and the artwork surface.

**Handle with care:**

Float-mounted art is more exposed than matted pieces. Handle by the backing, not the art edges. Keep clean until framing is complete.

## Float Mounting vs. Other Methods

| Method       | Full Art Visible | Edges Protected | Best For                   |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Float mount  | Yes              | No              | Art with interesting edges |
| Standard mat | No               | Yes             | Most photos and prints     |
| No mat       | Yes              | Partial         | Bold graphics, posters     |
| Window mat   | No               | Yes             | Traditional presentation   |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Using non-archival materials:**
Regular craft foam board contains acids that damage art over time. Always use archival foam board and archival tape.

**Backing too close to art size:**
If the backing is nearly the same size as the art, you won't see the float effect. Make it at least 1 inch smaller on all sides.

**Wrong frame depth:**
Standard frames are too shallow for float mounting. You need a shadowbox with at least 1 inch of depth, ideally 1.5-2 inches.

**Skipping the test fit:**
Before applying adhesive, test how everything will look in the frame. Adjust backing size if needed.

## Where Float Mounting Shines

Float mounting is popular for:

- **Gallery displays:** Professional, clean presentation
- **Art prints on specialty paper:** Shows off the paper quality
- **Watercolors and pastels:** Traditional fine art look
- **Limited editions:** Displays full sheet including signatures and edition numbers
- **Photography on fine art paper:** Modern, artistic presentation

## Get Started with Float Mounting

Float mounting transforms how artwork is displayed. It highlights the full piece, including edges and paper texture. The floating effect adds depth and visual interest that standard framing can't match.

Try float mounting for your next special piece. Use our [shadowbox frame designer](/shadowbox-frames) to find the perfect deep frame for your float-mounted artwork.

Create a display as unique as your art.
