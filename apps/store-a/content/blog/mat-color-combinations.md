Mat color is one of the most impactful decisions in custom framing—yet it's also one of the most intimidating. Choose the right mat and your artwork sings. Choose the wrong one and even beautiful art falls flat. The good news? You don't need to be a color theory expert. These seven tried-and-true mat color combinations work beautifully every time.

## Combo #1: Classic White Mat, Any Frame

**The combination**: Pure white mat with any frame color (black, natural wood, white, metal)

**Why it works**: White is the ultimate neutral. It creates clean separation between artwork and frame without competing for attention. White reflects light, making colors in your artwork appear more vibrant and true.

**Best for**:

- Color photographs and artwork
- Modern prints and graphics
- Bright, colorful pieces
- Contemporary spaces
- Gallery-style presentations

**When to use it**: When you want the artwork to be the absolute star. White mats disappear visually, putting 100% focus on what's inside the frame.

**Pro tip**: Use bright white (not off-white) for contemporary art and vibrant photos. The crisp white creates maximum contrast and color pop.

## Combo #2: Warm Cream Mat with Natural Wood Frame

**The combination**: Cream, off-white, or ivory mat paired with natural wood frame (oak, walnut, maple)

**Why it works**: Cream tones are warmer and softer than pure white, creating a vintage or traditional feel. Paired with natural wood, cream mats feel timeless and elegant—like they've been there forever.

**Best for**:

- Vintage photographs (especially sepia or black-and-white)
- Watercolor paintings
- Traditional or antique artwork
- Family heirlooms and historical documents
- Rustic or traditional home decor

**When to use it**: When you want warmth and nostalgia. Cream mats add a soft, aged quality that pure white can't achieve.

**Pro tip**: Match the undertones—cool cream with lighter woods (maple, pine), warmer cream with dark woods (walnut, mahogany).

## Combo #3: Black Mat with White Frame (or White Mat with Black Frame)

**The combination**: High-contrast pairing—black mat in white frame OR white mat in black frame

**Why it works**: This bold contrast creates instant drama and sophistication. The opposing colors frame your artwork with crisp, graphic impact.

**Best for**:

- Black and white photography
- Bold graphics and typography
- Modern abstract art
- Minimalist line drawings
- Contemporary spaces with clean lines

**When to use it**: When you want to make a statement. This combo works best with artwork that has strong composition and doesn't get lost in the bold framing.

**Pro tip**: Black mat + white frame = sophisticated and gallery-like. White mat + black frame = bold and graphic. Choose based on your style.

## Combo #4: Double Mat – White Top, Navy/Black Bottom

**The combination**: White or cream top mat with a thin navy blue or black reveal (bottom mat)

**Why it works**: The thin colored reveal adds depth and visual interest without overwhelming the artwork. It creates a "frame within a frame" effect that feels premium and intentional.

**Best for**:

- Diplomas and certificates
- Professional photography
- Special occasion photos (weddings, graduations)
- Artwork you want to elevate
- Traditional or formal spaces

**When to use it**: When you want to add sophistication without color commitment. The reveal is subtle enough to work with any artwork while adding dimension.

**Pro tip**: Keep the reveal thin—typically 1/4 inch. Anything wider can overpower the piece. Navy is more versatile than black for the reveal.

## Combo #5: Pull a Color from the Artwork

**The combination**: Mat color that matches a secondary or accent color within your artwork

**Why it works**: This creates cohesion between the mat and the art, making them feel connected. It amplifies colors within the piece and creates a custom, curated look.

**Best for**:

- Colorful artwork with multiple hues
- Paintings with a dominant color palette
- Prints where you want to emphasize certain colors
- Rooms where you're matching decor colors

**When to choose it**: When your artwork has a color you want to emphasize or when you want the frame to coordinate with room colors.

**How to do it right**:

1. Choose a **secondary** color, not the dominant one
2. Use muted or pastel versions rather than bright, saturated colors
3. Test the mat against the artwork—it should enhance, not compete
4. Consider sage green, dusty blue, soft gray, or muted terracotta

**Pro tip**: Avoid pulling the most dominant color—this can make the mat compete with the art. Instead, pull a subtle accent color for a sophisticated look.

## Combo #6: Light Gray Mat for Black and White Photography

**The combination**: Light or medium gray mat with black, white, or silver frame

**Why it works**: Gray is a neutral that complements black and white photography perfectly. It's softer than white but more modern than cream. Gray adds sophistication without warmth or coolness bias.

**Best for**:

- Black and white photography (especially modern)
- Charcoal drawings
- Graphite sketches
- Minimalist artwork
- Contemporary and industrial spaces

**When to use it**: When white feels too stark and cream feels too warm. Gray is the perfect middle ground for black and white artwork.

**Pro tip**: Use lighter grays (barely-there) for delicate photos, medium grays for bold compositions. Avoid dark grays unless your photo has high contrast.

## Combo #7: No Mat, Just Frame (With the Right Art)

**The combination**: Artwork directly in frame with no mat

**Why it works**: Sometimes less is more. No mat creates a clean, modern look and lets bold artwork extend right to the frame edge. It's also budget-friendly.

**Best for**:

- Posters and prints designed to bleed to the edges
- Abstract artwork and bold graphics
- Large-scale prints (16×20 and larger)
- Modern or minimalist spaces
- Budgets that prioritize multiple frames over mats

**When to use it**: When your artwork is bold enough to stand alone and you want a streamlined, contemporary presentation.

**Important**: Use the right [glazing](/glazing-guide) when going mat-less. Your art will be directly against the glass, so consider framer's grade acrylic or UV glass to prevent damage.

**Pro tip**: Add a thin frame liner (a small spacer between art and glass) to protect your artwork when framing without a mat. Many frame shops offer this option.

## White vs. Cream: When to Choose Each

This is one of the most common mat dilemmas. Here's how to decide:

**Choose bright white when**:

- Framing vibrant, colorful artwork
- Creating a modern, contemporary look
- Displaying photography with true-to-life colors
- You want maximum contrast and color pop
- Your space is modern, minimalist, or Scandinavian-inspired

**Choose cream/off-white when**:

- Framing vintage or antique photographs
- Creating a traditional, timeless look
- Working with sepia-toned or aged artwork
- You want warmth and softness
- Your space is traditional, rustic, or farmhouse-style

**Still unsure?** White is the safer choice—it works with 95% of artwork and spaces. When in doubt, go white.

## Matching Mats to Room Decor

Your mat doesn't exist in a vacuum—it should work with your room. Here's how to think about it:

**Neutral rooms** (whites, grays, blacks): You have freedom. Any of these mat combos will work beautifully.

**Colorful rooms**: Stick with white, cream, or gray mats. Let your walls and decor provide the color, not your mats.

**Themed rooms** (coastal, farmhouse, industrial): Choose mats that reinforce the theme:

- Coastal: whites and soft blues
- Farmhouse: creams and natural tones
- Industrial: grays and blacks

## Double Mat Color Ideas

If you're going with a double mat for added sophistication, try these winning combinations:

- White top + Navy reveal (classic, versatile)
- Cream top + Gold reveal (traditional, elegant)
- White top + Black reveal (modern, bold)
- Light gray top + Charcoal reveal (contemporary)
- Cream top + Burgundy reveal (rich, traditional)
