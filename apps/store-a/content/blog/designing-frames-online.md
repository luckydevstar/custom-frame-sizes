Ordering custom frames online offers convenience, better prices, and more options than traditional frame shops. But without the ability to see and touch materials in person, it's easy to make costly mistakes. Professional photographers, designers, and savvy customers know exactly what to check before clicking "order." Here's what they look for—and what you should too.

## 1. Accurate Measurements: The Foundation of Everything

**Why it matters**: One-quarter inch off can mean your artwork doesn't fit, or worse, rattles around loosely in an oversized frame.

**What pros check**:

### Measure Twice, Order Once

- **Artwork dimensions**: Measure your actual artwork, not what you _think_ the size is
- **Verify with ruler**: Use a metal ruler or tape measure, not a flexible fabric tape
- **Include mat calculations**: If using a mat, ensure mat opening matches artwork exactly

### Understanding Frame Dimensions

Online frame shops list sizes differently:

- **Image/Mat opening size**: The visible artwork area
- **Frame outer dimensions**: Total size of the frame
- **Frame rabbet**: The lip that holds everything in place

**Pro tip**: Always order by your **artwork size** (what will be visible), not by guessing frame outer dimensions.

### Use the Site's Measuring Guide

Reputable custom frame sites provide detailed measuring guides. Read them _before_ measuring. Learn more from our [how to measure guide](/how-to-measure).

## 2. Preview Tools: See Before You Buy

**Why it matters**: Colors, proportions, and style combinations look different than you imagine. Preview tools show exactly what you're getting.

**What pros check**:

### Real-Time Visual Preview

- **Frame + mat + glazing together**: See the complete combination
- **Color accuracy**: Check if preview shows true colors or approximations
- **Proportion preview**: Does the mat-to-frame ratio look balanced?
- **Multiple views**: Some tools offer front view, detail view, or 3D rotation

**Warning signs**: Sites without preview tools or with only generic product photos should be avoided. You need to see _your specific combination_.

### Upload Your Artwork

The best design tools let you upload your actual image to see it in the frame.

**Benefits**:

- See if mat color complements your artwork
- Check if frame style matches your art style
- Identify proportion issues before ordering

Not all sites offer this—but the best ones do, like our [frame designer](/).

### Test Multiple Combinations

Don't settle for your first design. Try:

- Different frame styles (wood, metal, ornate, simple)
- Various mat colors (white, cream, colored)
- Different mat widths (narrow, medium, wide)
- Glazing options (standard, UV, non-glare)

**Pro tip**: Screenshot your top 3 combinations and compare them side-by-side.

## 3. Material Quality Indicators

**Why it matters**: Not all frames are created equal. Quality materials look better and last longer.

**What pros check**:

### Frame Material Descriptions

Look for specific details, not vague marketing language:

**Good descriptions**:

- "Solid hardwood maple with hand-rubbed finish"
- "Aluminum frame with anodized coating"
- "Composite wood with archival backing"

**Red flags**:

- "Wood-style frame" (might be plastic)
- "Premium quality" (vague, meaningless)
- No material description at all

### Glazing Specifications

Verify what type of glazing is included:

- **Standard glass or acrylic**: Basic protection
- **UV-filtering**: Percentage of UV blocked (70%? 99%?)
- **Non-glare**: Etched or coated?
- **Museum glass**: True museum-grade or marketing term?

Legitimate sites clearly state glazing specs. See our [glazing guide](/glazing-guide) for what to look for.

### Mat Board Quality

Check if mats are:

- **Archival**: Essential for preservation
- **Conservation-grade**: Higher quality for valuable art
- **4-ply thickness**: Standard professional thickness
- **Bevel cut**: Clean, professional edges

### Backing and Hanging Hardware

Often overlooked, but important:

- **Backing board**: Archival? Rigid?
- **Hanging hardware**: Wire, D-rings, or sawtooth hangers?
- **Dust cover**: Professional backing paper included?

## 4. Pricing Transparency and Breakdown

**Why it matters**: Hidden fees and surprise costs destroy trust and your budget.

**What pros check**:

### Itemized Pricing

Quality sites show exactly what you're paying for:

- Frame cost
- Mat cost (if applicable)
- Glazing cost
- Hardware cost
- Any upgrades or add-ons

**Red flag**: A single total with no breakdown. You can't evaluate value without seeing costs.

### Shipping Costs (Before Checkout)

Shipping should be visible _during_ design, not at the final checkout screen.

**Good practice**: Shipping calculator based on size and location
**Bad practice**: "Shipping calculated at checkout" (surprise fees)

### No Hidden Fees

Watch for surprise charges:

- "Design fee" or "customization fee"
- "Handling fee" separate from shipping
- Minimum order requirements
- Rush fees not clearly stated upfront

Reputable custom frame sites (like CustomFrameSizes.com) show all costs up front with no surprises.

## 5. Size and Proportion Balance

**Why it matters**: Even with the right measurements, poor proportions ruin a frame's appearance.

**What pros check**:

### Mat Width Proportions

Mats should be proportional to artwork size:

- **Small artwork** (5×7, 8×10): 1.5-2.5" mats
- **Medium artwork** (11×14, 16×20): 2.5-3.5" mats
- **Large artwork** (20×24+): 3-4" mats

**Pro tip**: Preview mats at different widths. Too-narrow mats look cramped; too-wide mats overwhelm the art.

### Frame Width

Frame molding should balance artwork size:

- **Small frames**: Thin profile (0.5-1")
- **Medium frames**: Medium profile (1-1.5")
- **Large frames**: Can handle wider molding (1.5-2.5"+)

**Red flag**: Chunky, wide frames on small artwork look cartoonish. Thin frames on large artwork look flimsy.

### Bottom Mat Weighting

For professional look, make bottom mat border slightly wider (1/4-1/2") than top and sides. Many design tools offer this option.

Check if the tool allows or automatically applies bottom weighting.

## 6. Style Cohesion: Does Everything Work Together?

**Why it matters**: Individual elements might look great, but together they clash.

**What pros check**:

### Frame and Mat Harmony

Ask yourself:

- Does the frame style match the artwork era/style?
- Do mat colors complement (not compete with) the artwork?
- Is the overall look cohesive?

**Classic combinations that always work**:

- Black frame + white mat (timeless, modern)
- Natural wood + cream mat (warm, traditional)
- Metal frame + no mat (contemporary, clean)

See our [mat color combinations guide](/blog/mat-color-combinations) for more ideas.

### Consider Final Display Location

Think about where this will hang:

- **Modern home**: Sleek frames, clean lines, white/black/gray mats
- **Traditional home**: Wood frames, cream mats, classic styles
- **Eclectic home**: More freedom, but maintain some consistency

## 7. Reviews and Social Proof

**Why it matters**: Real customer experiences reveal quality, service, and reliability issues.

**What pros check**:

### Product Reviews

Look for reviews that mention:

- Quality of materials ("frame feels solid")
- Accuracy of preview ("looked exactly like the website")
- Packing quality ("arrived perfectly packed")
- Customer service responsiveness

**Red flags**:

- No reviews at all (new site or hiding feedback?)
- All 5-star reviews (fake or filtered?)
- Recent complaints about quality drops

### Company Reputation

Check:

- How long have they been in business?
- Do they have transparent contact information?
- Is there a clear return/exchange policy?
- Are there real customer photos (not just stock images)?

## 8. Turnaround Time and Shipping

**Why it matters**: Custom frames take time. Know what to expect before ordering.

**What pros check**:

### Production Time

Typical custom frame turnaround:

- **Fast**: 5-7 business days
- **Standard**: 10-14 business days
- **Slow**: 3-4 weeks

Know when you need your frame and order accordingly.

### Shipping Speed Options

Quality sites offer multiple shipping speeds:

- Standard (7-10 days)
- Expedited (3-5 days)
- Rush (1-2 days, if available)

### Tracking and Notifications

Look for:

- Order confirmation email
- Production updates
- Shipping notification with tracking
- Delivery confirmation

## 9. Return and Exchange Policies

**Why it matters**: Even with careful design, sometimes a frame doesn't work. You need options.

**What pros check**:

### Clear Return Policy

Must-haves in a good return policy:

- **Return window**: At least 14-30 days
- **Condition**: Unused/undamaged (reasonable)
- **Refund or exchange**: Both options available
- **Return shipping**: Who pays? (You or them?)

**Red flags**:

- "All custom orders are final" (too risky)
- No return policy listed (major red flag)
- Complicated, hard-to-find policy

### Damage Claims

Check the policy for damaged items:

- Report window (usually 48-72 hours)
- Photo documentation required?
- Replacement or refund offered?

## 10. Customer Support Accessibility

**Why it matters**: Questions arise. Can you get help?

**What pros check**:

### Multiple Contact Methods

Look for:

- Live chat (best for quick questions)
- Phone number (speak to a person)
- Email support (detailed questions)
- FAQ/knowledge base (self-service)

**Red flag**: Only a contact form with no phone or chat option.

### Response Time

Check reviews for support responsiveness:

- Do they answer questions quickly?
- Are representatives knowledgeable?
- Do they resolve issues fairly?
