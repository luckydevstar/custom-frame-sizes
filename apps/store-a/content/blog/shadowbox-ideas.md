Some memories won't fit in a standard frame. Sports jerseys, military medals, concert tickets, vinyl records—these three-dimensional treasures deserve displays as special as the memories they represent. Shadowbox frames create depth to showcase your most meaningful collectibles while protecting them from damage and dust.

## What Is a Shadowbox Frame?

A shadowbox is a deep frame (typically 1-3 inches deep) with space between the glazing and backing. This depth accommodates three-dimensional objects while keeping them protected behind glass or acrylic.

**Shadowbox components**:

- **Deep frame**: Creates space for 3D objects
- **Glazing**: Protects items from dust and damage
- **Backing board**: Sturdy base for mounting items
- **Mounting**: Methods to secure objects (pins, adhesive, fabric, etc.)

Now, let's explore specific shadowbox projects and how to execute them successfully.

## Jersey and Sports Uniform Display

**What you'll need**:

- Deep shadowbox (2-3 inches minimum depth)
- Large size (24×30 to 32×40, depending on jersey size)
- Framer's grade acrylic (jerseys fade easily)
- Foam board or padded backing

**Mounting technique**:

1. Fold jersey to display front with number visible
2. Pin or carefully stitch to backing board through seams (not through fabric face)
3. Tuck sleeves behind or fold neatly to sides
4. Add nameplate with player name, team, and year

**Display options**:

- **Full jersey**: Show entire front or back
- **Partial jersey**: Fold to feature number and name
- **Combined display**: Add team photo, ticket stubs, or stats card

**Pro tips**:

- Use archival materials to prevent yellowing
- Ensure adequate depth so jersey doesn't press against glass
- Consider professional jersey framing service for expensive or signed jerseys

**Depth needed**: 2-3 inches

## Military Medals and Decorations

**What you'll need**:

- Shadowbox (1.5-2 inches deep)
- Medium size (16×20 or 20×24)
- Fabric backing (navy, black, or service-specific color)
- Display bar or medal mounting board

**Mounting technique**:

1. Use military medal mounting bars (proper display order)
2. Pin ribbons to fabric backing
3. Add rank insignia, badges, or patches
4. Include photo, flag, or service documents if desired

**Layout ideas**:

- **Formal military style**: Medals arranged in official order per military guidelines
- **Memorial tribute**: Photo, flag, medals, and service information
- **Career retrospective**: Medals, patches, photos spanning entire service

**Additional elements**:

- Service ribbons
- Unit patches
- Rank insignias
- Challenge coins
- Dog tags
- Military photo

**Depth needed**: 1.5-2 inches

## Playbills, Concert Tickets, and Event Memorabilia

**What you'll need**:

- Shadowbox (1-2 inches deep)
- Size based on item quantity (11×14 to 20×24)
- Decorative background paper or fabric
- Mounting adhesive or pins

**What to include**:

- Playbills or programs
- Concert tickets or stubs
- Backstage passes
- Autographs
- Photos from the event
- Setlists or tour merchandise

**Layout approaches**:

**Single event focus**:

- Center the playbill or main item
- Surround with tickets, photos, and memorabilia
- Add event details on nameplate

**Collection display**:

- Multiple events in grid or collage layout
- Broadway show collection
- Music tour history
- Festival or concert series

**Pro tips**:

- Use UV-protective glazing (printed materials fade quickly)
- Scan originals before mounting (digital backup)
- Leave items unmounted if very valuable (use photo-safe corners)

**Depth needed**: 1-2 inches

## Vinyl Records and Album Covers

**What you'll need**:

- Shadowbox (2 inches deep minimum)
- 12×12 for single record/cover
- Multiple sizes available for multi-record displays
- Background that complements album art

**Display options**:

**Album cover + record**:

- Mount album cover as backdrop
- Display vinyl record partially overlapping or next to cover
- Add artist info nameplate

**Signed album**:

- Feature autographed album cover
- Optional: Include photo of signing event or concert ticket

**Collection display**:

- Multiple albums in grid (favorite band's discography)
- Genre collection (jazz classics, punk albums, etc.)
- Themed display (albums from specific year or era)

**Mounting technique**:

- Use clear acrylic stands or pins to hold record
- Mount album cover flat to backing
- Ensure record doesn't touch glass (oil from vinyl can mark it over time)

**Pro tips**:

- Never play a record after framing (oils and dust make it unplayable)
- Frame duplicate or less valuable copies if possible
- Consider displaying album cover only and storing actual record safely

**Depth needed**: 2-3 inches

**Depth needed**: 1-3 inches depending on object size

## Shadowbox Design Tips

### Choose the Right Depth

- **1 inch**: Flat items with slight dimension (thick paper, ribbons)
- **1.5-2 inches**: Medals, playbills, folded fabrics, small objects
- **2-3 inches**: Jerseys, vinyl records, bulky memorabilia

### Background Matters

Your background sets the tone:

- **Fabric**: Elegant, textured, hides pins and mounting
- **Colored paper**: Clean, modern, affordable
- **Team/event colors**: Reinforce theme
- **Neutral (white, cream, black)**: Keeps focus on objects

### Mounting Methods

- **Pins**: Quick, adjustable, works through fabric backing
- **Adhesive**: Permanent, clean look (use archival)
- **Stitching**: Secure for fabrics, invisible from front
- **Acrylic stands**: For records, watches, or display-worthy items
- **Photo corners**: Removable, safe for valuable items

### Glazing Considerations

- **UV protection**: Essential for fabrics, printed materials, and photos
- **Acrylic**: Lighter, safer, recommended for large shadowboxes
- **Non-glare**: Helpful for dimensional items (reduces distracting reflections)

See our [glazing guide](/glazing-guide) for detailed information.

### Add Context with Labels

Nameplates or engraved plaques add meaning:

- Event name and date
- Player name and stats
- Military service dates and rank
- Travel destination and year
- Collection theme

## Where to Buy Shadowbox Frames

- **Online custom framing**: Best selection and customization (like CustomFrameSizes.com)
- **Craft stores**: Pre-made shadowboxes in standard sizes
- **Specialty frame shops**: Custom work, professional mounting
- **DIY**: Build your own for unique sizes and maximum budget savings
